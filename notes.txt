--> Header.js
--> Layout.js
--> Home.js
--> UI/Input - index.js
--> Signin/signup

--------------------
(*) Redux
--------------------

--> reducers : index.js [export function with state obj]
    export default (state = { name: "talha" }, action) => {
    return state;
    };

--> store : index.js [import reducer and store it in]
    import { createStore } from "redux";
    import rootReducer from "../reducers";
    const store = createStore(rootReducer);

    export default store;


--> index.js : provider
  <Provider store={store}>  </Provider>,




--> action.js : auth.actions.js 
    import { authConstant } from "../constant";

    export const login = (user) => {
    return (dispatch) => {
            dispatch({
            type: authConstant.LOGIN_REQUEST,
            payload: {
                login: true,
            },
            });
        };
    };




--> import this action in component



--> we dispatch form login which gose to the action
--> but from actions it has to go at reducers 
--> for these async action we use middleware "thunk"


--> Access For Dashboard & Restric Signin 

    - in Privateroute we have declare that is admin has token then and only then he can access dashborad otherwise directed to sign in page
    
    - in signin.js we make api call 
    - check in action status code 200
    - update authenticated to TRUE in store

    - in signin.js we take that authenticated value from store and check if it is TRUE then redirect to 'Dashboard'

    - if are redirected toward Dashboard now in URL we write /signin so it will take us to sign in page 
    - But Admin have already completed sign in so login page should not be visible to admin
    - But why this is happening we have writter code for redirect then what happen..?
    - When we write /signin in URL the entire page RELOAD and becauase of that Store values became NULL

    - so we have to check on every page load that token is exists or not if yes then authenticated : TRUE 
     









----------------
(*) sidebar
----------------

-> menu me jakar uski z-index badha dena 

<Layout>
    <Container fluid>
    <Row>
        <Col md={2} className="sidebar">
        Side bar
        </Col>
        <Col style={{ marginLeft: "auto" }} md={10}>
        container
        </Col>
    </Row>
    </Container>
</Layout>


.sidebar {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  background-color: #eee;
  padding-top: 60px;
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 5px gray;
}




--> scrollbar hata ne k liye container ka use karo




--> products and orders are access by admin only so that we make them as a Privateroute

--> in order and product we want same layout so we write in <Layout> tag 

--> now check App.js

    <PrivateRoute path="/products" component={() => <Product />} />
    <PrivateRoute path="/orders" component={() => <Orders />} />


--> Now, in product component

    import React from "react";
    import Layout from "../../components/Layout";

    const Product = (props) => {
    return <Layout sidebar>Products</Layout>;
    };

    export default Product;


--> Why sidebar as a props....?
    - because we want sidebar same as home page in product and order also 

--> the component which need sidebar they pass sidebar as  a props and those component who do not need sidebar they simpley called <Layout>

    - signin and signup don't require sidebar so they simpley called <Layout>
    - product and order and home require sidebar so they called <Layout sidebar>

    - in Layout we check that if props.sidebar exists then show them 
    - if they don't exist simply return those component








-------------------------------
(*) Storing Image
-------------------------------

- Image [http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/multer.html]
    - we use multer for accepting files[.pdf, .pnj anything]
    - const storage = multer.diskStorage({
        destination : 
            -where we want to store image [\uploads folder],
            - no des given then the operating system's default directory for temporary files is used
        filename : 
            - we have to write file.originalname so that we get file with extention other wise 
            - each file will be given a random name that doesn't include any file extension
    })

    - we pass this storage into multer 
        - const upload =  multer({storage}) 
    
    - in upload we have destination and filename 
    - at the time of api request we check on entry level
    - upload.single(fieldName)
        - fieldName must be same

    - Single File [upload.single], Multiple File [upload.array('profiles')]
    - for single and multiple the code remain same

    - In controller we get this file using req.file || req.files


    - Now how we store image in db...?
        - Upload Folder
            - we sotre uploaded file in our directly
            - using shortid we will add some random string before file name
            - so file name will be unique
        - Path in DB
            - we store path like http://localhost:8000/public/filename
            - public so that we can access file direct from browser
            - But we have to define public as static in middleware 
            - Means when user access image in browser using public it hit on middleware 
            - IN that middleware we have define path to the /upload folder so it will go there and display image

            - Example : 
                app.use("/public", express.static(path.join(__dirname, `\\src\\uploads`)));




----------------------------------
(*) Product and category
----------------------------------

--> a product must have a category so first we will see what we can store in category table

--> Category : name, slug,categoryImage[logo] , parentId
    - a category can have sub-category 
    - example : Electronice have Mobile,laptop, camera etc..
    - so it must have ParentId
    {
        name,
        slug,
        categoryImage[path],
        parentId
    }

    - cat_1 = Electronice, parentId : Nothing
    - cat_2 = Mobile, parentId : Electronice_ID
    - cat_3 = Samsung, parentId : Mobile_ID



--> Get Category :
    - when we get all category like { name, slug, categoryImage, parentId }
    - now at the time of getting all categories we also need which category has sub category
    - which means how many children has 
    - cat_1 Electronice -> Mobile
    - cat_2 Mobile -> Samsung, Nokia



--> Step_1
    - first we have to take all categories who don't have parentId
    - we got 4-5 result
    - then declaring 1 array and store all individual category into that array
    - we write for loop and push each category into array 
    - BUT wait
    - here we add 1 new property called 'children' 
    - 'children' hold all the sub category 
    - example : Electronice -> mobile, laptop, camera


--> Step_2
    - how we can find childrens of cat_1...?
    - so we have cat_1's Id which is parentId in other categories
    - so we check that which categories has parentId as cat_id ID
    - for that we have to pass cat_id and allCategory object




--> So we have an array which have all category and nested categories also
--> so we return  this array to client





    


------------------------------------
(*) FLOW
------------------------------------

    - React
        - on page load [App.js] we dispatch getInitialData()
        - on that action we make api call   
            - http://localhost:8000/api/initialData
    - Node
        - we fetch Product and Category data from database
    
    - React 
        - Reducer  : initialData.action.js
            - called this pre-defined reducer's method
            - GET_ALL_CATEGORIES_SUCCESS
            - GET_ALL_PRODUCTS_SUCCESS
        
        - Store : data store in 'Store'

        - Category.js : 
            -  const category = useSelector((state) => state.category);

        


----------------------------
(*) Category Edit
---------------------------

--> CheckboxTree is used to display data in tree formate
--> it has 1 parameter called "node"
--> in renderCategories 
    - we created 1 array which hold 
        [
            {
                label - name of category,
                value - id of that category,
                children - {
                    label, value, children
                }
            }
        ]
--> this array passed in CheckboxTree


--> we need to trake which values are checked and which are expaned so we declare 2 variable called 
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState([]);
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState([]);



--> onCheck = will add all checked value in "checked" variable,
--> onExpanded = will add all expanded value in "expanded" variable,


--> Now in checked and expanded variable holds the ID of that array



--> EDIT Category
    - when user click on Edit
    - setUpdateCategoryModel becomes true
    - and we call createCategoryList function to take array of
        categories = [
            {
                value = cat_id
                name = cat_name
                parentId = cat_parentId
            }
        ]


    - "checked" variable we have all checked ID's
    - categories variable we have { value, name, parentId}
    - checkedId === categories.value so we get {name,value,parentId}
    - so we store checked value name and parentId in checkedArray same gose to expandedArray
    - and we set this array in global variable checkedArray & expandedArray


--> Edit Model Open
    - we loop throw checkedArray and display details in model
    - we loop throw expandedArray and display details in model

    - Edit Name
        - handleCategoryInput we write edit logic




--> Take Care
(1)Category.js : 
    - const category = useSelector((state) => state.category);
    - display data using category object



--> Image   
    - if we store single image for single record
    - then we should use unique id of record as file name 
    - and store in upload folder so old image overwrite by new image 


    --> Image Save
        --> front-end se base64 me convert kar k bhejna 
        --> back-end me check karna image hai ki nahi
        --> nahi hai to error 
        --> hai to image ka nama with extention DB me save karna hai

    --> Image Get   
        --> database mese image ka naam get karna
        --> ab controller me image naam ko upload k sath map kar k get karna hai
        --> us image ko base64 me convert karn k front-end ko bhej dena [src]



----------------------------
(*) QueryString
----------------------------

--> In db we have category with {id, name, slug, parentId, type, children} [Controller : category.js]

--> 
    - On header we display total categories with <a> tag [MenuHeader.js]
    - <a href=""> we have to pass like 
        - <a href=`/${cat.slug}?cid=${cat.id}&type=${cat.type}`
    
    - So, when user click on a tag it will she the URL in the above formate


--> Now it will redirect to <Route path="/:slug" component={ProductListPage}/> in App.js
--> Now in ProductListPage.js page we extract info from URL and check what type it is...?
--> And respectd page will be shown 





----------------------------
(*) .map on Object
----------------------------


--> if we want to operate .map function on Object we can use Object.keys(objectName)
--> which create an array of keys
{
    "1" : { },
    "2" : { },
    "3" : { }
}  

so it will create array like ["1","2","3"] now we can loop through them


Object.keys(objectName).map( (key, index) => {
    console.log( objectName[key] )
})
























--> Changes
    - when page load - get request of only 5 record
    - on record click - getDetails by id
    - store image in base64
