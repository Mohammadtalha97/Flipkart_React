/*

(1)
 - when admin time /signin in URL page reload and Store became null
 - so that's why authenticated is false
 - in action we check that
 - OK, admin is logged in which means token is stord in localstorage
 - so we check that is token is there than we update the authenticated to TRUE
 - so we can achive REDIRECT functionality


(2)
  - when we are on Dashboard and click on singin we see signin page for 1/5 milisecond
  - WHY..? because we are setting on Dashboard and out checking happen on sing in page 
  - Solution..?
  - checking happen on Dashboard level so copy useEffect from here to Dashboard

(3)
  - we need to perform checking on every page insted of that 
  - we remove <Route> from App.js to index.js
  - and write checking useEffect on TOP Level
